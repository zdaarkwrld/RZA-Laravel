                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Most birds have hollow, air-filled bones to help them stay light for flight. Penguins adapted with solid bones instead. This helps them swim because solid bones reduce buoyancy—the tendency to float.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        That’s because penguins live south of the equator while polar bears north of the equator in Arctic!

                        Some species of penguins can march up to about 60 miles across sea ice to get to their breeding grounds. Penguin feet are also adapted to help the birds steer while swimming. They use their feet like rudders, angling them to help control direction.
