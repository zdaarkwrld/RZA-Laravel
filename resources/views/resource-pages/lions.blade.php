                Sumatran tigers are classified on the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered with less than 400
                individuals left in the wild of Sumatra, Indonesia.

                The smallest of the sub-species, they hide and travel at dawn and dusk in hope to hunt in crop areas and
                outskirts of the forest. Male Sumatran tigers have particularly long fur around the face, giving them a
                distinctive masked appearance.

                    An apex predator, tigers are carnivorous and their diet consists of ungulates such as deer, wild
                    pigs, and bovids. They typically hunt at night, stalking their prey and ambushing it from behind,
                    killing it with a bite to the neck.

                    The main threats to Sumatran tigers in the wild include poaching for skins and body parts, depletion
                    of prey species due to habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, where tigers and humans are encroaching
                    areas towards each other. Natural factors such as inbreeding and loss of habitat due to palm oil
                    expansion, movement, and hunting of tiger prey species.
