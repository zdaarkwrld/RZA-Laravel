                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        African lions are mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa. They used to be found all over Africa but now they have mostly disappeared from North Africa and are at risk of extinction in West Africa. Lions live in savannahs and grasslands, where some cover and plenty of water can be found.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        If lions are your favourite animal you can adopt a lion for a one off payment that includes a cuddly lion toy, an adoption certificate, a lion fact sheet and the name of the adopter displayed at the lion enclosure.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Lions hunt for food every few days. They will feed from their kill and then rest until they hunt again. We follow this pattern in zoos, as our lions have two “starve” days out of seven. They usually kill medium sized mammals, such as zebra, deer and wildebeest. They often eat animals which have been killed by another hunter, such as hyenas.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">What noise do lions make?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Both male and female lions roar. They usually start off with a few long, deep roars followed by shorter, faster ones. Lions also make other noises. They meow, hiss and snarl, like domestic cats, but louder.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Male lions are much bigger than females and they have large manes, or hair, which covers their head and neck and stretches underneath to their belly. Lion cubs have light spots on their fur when they are born. These fade when they grow up and they help camouflage, or hide, them when they’re young.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Lions are the laziest of all the big cats, and can sleep for 16-20 hours each day.
